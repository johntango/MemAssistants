3,"CrewAI is an experimental feature in OpenAI's language model. It allows the model to perform tasks using a set of specialized tools, called 'capabilities', which extend the functionality of the base language model. Each capability is like a plugin that the model can use to perform a different kind of task. An example of a CrewAI capability is the ability to search a user's uploaded files with 'msearch'. The capabilities of CrewAI can help with tasks like summarizing documents, performing specific calculations, or storing and retrieving information.",
