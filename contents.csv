It allows the model to perform tasks using a set of specialized tools, called 'capabilities', which extend the functionality of the base language model. Each capability is like a plugin that the model can use to perform a different kind of task. An example of a CrewAI capability is the ability to search a user's uploaded files with 'msearch'.
